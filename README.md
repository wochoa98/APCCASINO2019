# Casino Simulation


The casino simulation is a culmination of a semester-long project to create a realistic simulator that can play up to 5 different games made for the casino. The players within the casino act dynamically, with different play styles and movements about the casino. The game compiles the statistics of each game and player based on the game settings chose at the start of the simulation.

## Starting the Simulator

Download the folder "casino" onto your computer, and use FileZilla or some other FTP client to put the files onto putty. You will need all of the files in the same folder, however, in order to run it only requires the line "python casino.py". From there, the simulator will open with a main menu that guides the user through the setup.

## Setting up the Simulation

The simulator opens with a user menu, allowing the user to choose what games run and under what conditions those games run. Each option comes with specific instructions on how to choose the settings. If a game is run, it comes with one or more variable settings, such as the vig for a poker table, that can be changed to offer different statistics at the output. The user can then see how the different vig or table minimum or other factor affects the casino's intake or individual play. Be sure to follow the menu instructions carefully.
